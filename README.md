# INDEED_JOB_SCRAPER

This is a Practice Project meant to experiment with bypassing the anti-bot technologies.

## Instructions to run:

`Check python install`<br>
First make sure you have python installed on your system:<br>
*(make sure you have python installed on your windows or linux machine)*
```bash
python --version
```
if it returns an error, install python on your system first<br>
<br>
`Install necessary python modules`<br>
I have listed all the packages in the text file and you have to install them with the following command:
```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```
<br>

`Run the html_to_csv.py file`
<br>
after all the steps, run the file to see results:
```bash
python html_to_csv.py
```
or
```bash
python3 html_to_csv.py
```

All the data will be stored in an 'output.csv' file
